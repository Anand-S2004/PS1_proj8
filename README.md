# PS1_proj8
Using reverse engineered Java Classes to move JSON objects using the gilhari microservice
This project is an initiative possible by the collaboration of BITS-pilani and Software Tree, California under the PS1 drive. Many thanks to Mr. Damodar Periwal, founder and CEO of Software Tree, Faculty in charge Prof. Girish Kant Garg for helping the group with all its technical and structural queries.



This project will use Software Tree's products JDX (an ORM mapping tool) and Gilhari to first reverse engineer Java classes from an ORM mapping, and then running the Gilhari app specific microservice in a docker image to transfer JSON data in and out of the RDBMS.
